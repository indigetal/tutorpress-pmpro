Project brief for TutorPress â€” PMPro integration

Goal:
Implement a Paid Memberships Pro integration inside TutorPress's Gutenberg course builder that matches Tutor LMS 3.0's native commerce features, allowing instructors to configure membership-based pricing and subscription options per course.

Scope:

- Build as a standalone TutorPress addon that requires TutorPress and Tutor LMS Pro.
- Mirror Tutor LMS native commerce "Pricing Model" and "Subscription" capabilities within the Gutenberg UI.
- Integrate PMPro and Tutor LMS enrollment/subscription APIs.

Stakeholders:

- Instructors: configure pricing and membership requirements per course.
- Site admins: manage PMPro settings and view enrollment reports.

Success Criteria:

- Instructors can assign PMPro membership levels to courses via the Gutenberg builder.
- Course enrollment and access respect PMPro membership status and Tutor LMS subscription settings.
