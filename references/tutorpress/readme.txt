== Description ==
Premium Gutenberg-native course builder for Tutor LMS with a 14-day Freemius trial.

TutorPress modernizes Tutor LMS by replacing the legacy frontend course builder with a WordPress-first, Gutenberg-native course authoring experience. Built with REST API endpoints, TypeScript-powered frontend stores, and WordPress data store patterns, TutorPress restores standard template hierarchy and comment support while providing advanced course creation tools.

Key capabilities:
- Native Gutenberg course editing (course edit links redirect to Gutenberg)
- Interactive Course Curriculum metabox with drag-and-drop reordering
- Advanced Quiz Builder and Interactive Quiz (H5P) integration
- Right-hand Course & Lesson settings panels in the Gutenberg sidebar
- Payment engine integrations (WooCommerce, EDD, PMP) with product linking and price sync
- Automated metadata sync for course ratings and reviews

TutorPress is a premium-only plugin; all premium features are available during the 14-day trial and gated via Freemius with server-side enforcement to prevent client-side bypass.

== Installation ==
1. Backup site
2. Upload plugin ZIP to Plugins → Add New → Upload
3. Activate and start the 14-day Freemius trial or enter license
